# Ovidism philosophy

Until when will we be controlled and ruled by a batch of old laws and believes, gathered in a small hand of people controlled by money and corporations. Capitalism build around us a world of fake dreams and infinite debt to whom we are just a bunch of slaves and instruments.

We are the people, we are the crowd, we should decide together the laws, what is right and what is wrong. Until now, I believe science proved its unique importance.

I propose a dynamic life and society which is based on fundamental and realistic needs of every individual as well for every society: 
•	Knowledge
•	Family
•	Health
•	Well being

As many studies already show, we are influenced by society and people around us: if people are laughing and feel good, we are also feeling good and vice-versa. This creates a direct need for us to have interest that people around us and the society that we live in to be happy and healthy. This is what most people think and feel in my opinion and this represents the fundamentals of my philosophy.

Most would say this it’s a utopic world filled with pink and flowers which will never happen. But shouldn’t we at least tend to approach it? If your answer is no, you can stop reading.

This is not socialism, collectivism, communism, capitalist, nationalism or any other known philosophy, but might contain beliefs from many of them and add modern ideas based on evolution, science and technology. It also might reject parts from the above specified philosophies and other. 

I am not a highly educated philosopher and neither I read known philosophies or work of philosophes. My writing resembles my thoughts and worries, gained from living, working, watching the world around and thinking. Not everything might make sense but everything is opened to review and modification exactly the same as the philosophy proposes the society: a continuous integration, development and applicability.
